2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0 and PixelClkIO_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks PixelClkIO_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1 and PixelClkIO are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks PixelClkIO]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#5 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#6 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.604 ns between mmap_i/display/vidsel_0/inst/vsync_out_reg/C (clocked by clk_out1_mmap_clk_wiz_0) and mmap_i/line_0/inst/ready_reg/D (clocked by clk_fpga_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
